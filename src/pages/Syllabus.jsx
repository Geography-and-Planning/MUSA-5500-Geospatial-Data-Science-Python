        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
        This course will provide students with the knowledge and tools to turn data into meaningful insights, with a focus on real-world case studies in the urban planning and public policy realm. Focusing on the latest Python software tools, the course will outline the “pipeline” approach to data science. It will teach students the tools to gather, manipulate, visualize, and analyze datasets, providing the skills to effectively explore geospatial datasets and transform results into understandable and compelling narratives. The course is organized into five main sections:
        </p>

        <ol className="list-tight">
          <li><strong>Exploratory Data Science:</strong> Students will be introduced the basics of Python, data structure, read and write different types of files, string operations, loops, and functions/classes. Students will be introduced to the main tools needed to get started analyzing and visualizing data using Python.</li>
          <li><strong>Introduction to Geospatial Data Science:</strong> Building on the previous set of tools, this module will teach students how to work with geospatial datasets using a range of modern Python toolkits.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Ingestion & Big Data:</strong> Students will learn how to collect new data through web scraping and APIs, as well as how to work effectively with the large datasets often encountered in real-world applications.</li>
          <li><strong>From Exploration to Storytelling:</strong> With a solid foundation, students will learn the latest tools to present their analysis results using web-based formats to transform their insights into interactive stories.</li>
          <li><strong>Geospatial Data Science in the Wild:</strong> Armed with the necessary data science tools, the final module introduces a range of advanced analytic and machine learning techniques using a number of innovative examples from modern researchers.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section className="section">
        <h2>Lecture & Lab</h2>
        <p>
        The lecture part is focus on explaining the concepts, theories, and best practices for writing Python script. The lecture is intended, as much as possible, to be an interactive environment.  Please feel free at any time during the lecture to ask a question or make a comment. Conversely, you are expected to respond to discussion questions asked in class.
        </p>

        <p>The remainder of each class following the lecture will be devoted to the lab.  During the lab, students work on lab assignments that provide practical experience in applying the concepts learned in the lecture. You are highly recommended to have your own machine for this class. </p>
      </section>

      <section className="section">
        <h2>Assignments & Final Project</h2>
        <p>
          There are six homework assignments and one required final project at the end of the semester. While you are required to submit all six assignments, the assignment with the lowest grade will not count towards your final grade.
          
        </p>
        <p>        
          For the final project, students will replicate the pipeline approach on a dataset (or datasets) of their choosing. Students will be required to use several of the analysis techniques taught in the class and produce a web-based data visualization that effectively communicates the empirical results to a non-technical audience. The final product should also include a description of the methods used in each step of the data science process (collection, analysis, and visualization).
        </p>

        <p>See the Final Project page for details.</p>

        MUSA 5500 is a fast-paced course that covers a lot of topics in a short amount of time. I know that it can be overwhelming and frustrating, particularly as you are trying to learn Python syntax and the topics in the course at the same time. But I firmly believe that all students can succeed in this class.You’ll get the most out of the course if you stay up to date on the lectures and assignments. If you fall behind, I know there can be a desire to copy code from the Internet or others to help you complete assignments. Ultimately, this will be detrimental to your progress as an analytics wizard. My goal for this course is for everyone to learn and engage with the material to the best of their ability. If you find yourself falling behind or struggling with Python issues, please ask for help by:
